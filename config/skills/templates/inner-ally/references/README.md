# inner-ally references

This directory is where you add reference material for your personal inner-ally skill.

## Suggested Reference Files

- **personality-profile.md** — Your full personality framework analysis (MBTI, Enneagram, DISC, neurodivergence, etc.)
- **session-patterns.md** — Your specific work session patterns: energy curves, avoidance behaviors, recovery strategies
- **evidence-bank.md** — Concrete examples of past successes to draw on when you doubt yourself

## How to Use

The SKILL.md capsules reference this material for depth. When you fill in the capsules, add supporting detail here rather than making SKILL.md too long.

Keep these files private — they contain personal information and should never be committed to a public repository.
