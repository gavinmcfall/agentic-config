# Review and Document Patterns

## Review Priority (High to Low)

1. **Correctness** — Does it work? Logic errors, edge cases
2. **Security** — OWASP Top 10, input validation, secrets
3. **Architecture** — SOLID, coupling, layer boundaries
4. **Performance** — Only measured hotspots
5. **Tests** — Coverage of critical paths
6. **Style** — Only if egregious
